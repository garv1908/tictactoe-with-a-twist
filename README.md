# TicTacToe but you can't win!

## More information:

This project is in development, and I hope to gain more practice out of coding this. It's pretty beginner friendly too!
I want to further create an algorithm/series of instructions for the computer to play a perfect game, forcibly making you either draw, or lose!

I also want to see if I can take a bit of a spin on the idea and make a game where you cannot lose (i.e. you always win!)
